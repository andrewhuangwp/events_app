Design Decisions:
Login using only email, anyone can create user and event, anyone can edit event, no email validation yet, events can take place before current date, anyone can create user but only users logged in can create events. Participants and invites not implemented since not specified in requirements.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
